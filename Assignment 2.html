	<h1>Assignment 2</h1>

	<h2>Goal</h2>

	<p>
	The goal is the second assignment is to familiarize students
	with the use of cryptographic libraries. This is an assignment for
	<b>individuals</b> - no group work or collaboration allowed. Violations
	of the UF Honor code will be reported to the Office of Student Integrity
	immediately, and students will fail the course.
	</p>

	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
	<b>Due:</b> September 21, 2022, via Canvas <i>by</i> 5:00pm EDT.<br>
	<b>Points:</b> 90
	</p>

	<p>
	In this homework you will create file encryption/decryption/transmission
	suite akin to scp using <i>OpenSSL</i> libraries provided by the Linux
	operating system.  Details of this assignment are given below.
	</p>

	<ul> 
	    <li>The programs are to be written in 'C/C++' and use the 
	    <i>openssl</i> library.  The <i>make</i> utility must be 
	    used to create the program.

	    </li><li>The file encryption programs <i>ufsend</i> and 
	    <i>ufrec</i> should take the following inputs: <br>
	    <pre>ufsend &lt;input file&gt; [-d &lt; IP-addr:port &gt;][-l]</pre> 
	    <pre>ufrec &lt;filename&gt;  [-d &lt; port &gt;][-l] 
	    </pre>

	where ufsend takes an input file and transmits it to the IP
	address/port specified on the command-line (-d option), or dumps the
	encrypted contents of the input file to an output file of the same
	name, but with the added extension <i>`` .ufsec''</i> e.g., if the input
	file is <i>hello.txt</i>, the output file should <i>hello.txt.ufsec</i>.

	ufrec should run as a network daemon (-d), awaiting incoming network
	connections on the command-line specified network port. When a
	connection comes in, it writes the file data to "filename" and exits.
	ufrec can also be run in local mode (-l) in which it bypasses the
	network functionality and simply decrypts a file specified as input.
	It is assumed that the input file (for decryption) ends ".ufsec", so the
	output will be the original filename without this additional extension.
	(This is simply the inverse of ufsend).   

	</li><li>On each invocation, <i>ufsend</i> and <i>ufrec</i> should
	prompt the user for a password. This password will be used to securely
	generate an encryption using PBKDF2 (Password Based Key Derivation
	Function 2).  When running PBKDF2, use SHA3-256 with 4096 iterations and
	the string "SodiumChloride" as the salt. <i>openssl</i> implements 
	PBKDF2, so use their implementation. After generation, for grading the 
	key should be printed as a hexadecimal number as in the example 
	execution below.
        
	</li><li>Encryption must be done using AES256 in Galois Counter Mode
	(GCM) Mode. Be sure to initialize the IV of each invocation to a
	cryptographically generated pseudorandom number.

	</li><li>Both <i>ufsend</i> and <i>ufrec</i> should display an
	error and abort the operation if the output file already exists.
	main() should return 33 when this happens.

	</li><li>To turn in: you will create a tar file named <i> &lt; lastname
	&gt;-assign2.tgz</i> which contains a single directory <i>&lt; lastname
	&gt;-assign2</i> which contains the Makefile and all of your source
	code for the program. All source code and the makefile should be
	extensively commented.  I should be able to run the following commands
	(after retrieving the file from Canvas):

	    <pre>	    tar xvfz &lt; lastname &gt;-assign2.tgz
	    cd &lt; lastname &gt;-assign2
	    make
	    cp ufsend testfile.check
	    ./ufsend testfile.check -l
	    rm testfile.check
            ./ufrec testfile.check.ufsec -l
            diff testfile.check ufsend
	    </pre>

	    <b>Warning:</b> If I cannot do these minimal operations
	    successfully, you will not receive a passing grade.  This is not
        all I will test---I have another battery of tests I will do when
        grading including carefully reviewing your code. While developing on
        any  *nix system is fine, your code <i>must</i> run correctly
        on Linux. I recommend testing on the thunder machine before
        submission.

    </li></ul>

	class you are prohibited from copying any content from the Internet

	An example session using these tools <i>might</i> look like
	(this is not actual output):
	</p>

	<pre>	octave% ./ufsend testfile -d 192.168.1.48:8888
	Password: example
	Key: FA 3A 2F D3 7E CB 27 F2 B3 42 35 06 CF B1 ED 0E 
	Successfully encrypted testfile to testfile.uf (6512 bytes written).
	0B 2D 66 A4 1F (and all the rest...)
	Transmitting to 192.168.1.42:8888
        Successfully received

	-----

	nittany% ./ufrec testfile -d 8888
	Waiting for connections.   
	Inbound file. 
	0B 2D 66 A4 1F (and all the rest...)
	Password: example
	Key: FA 3A 2F D3 7E CB 27 F2 B3 42 35 06 CF B1 ED 0E 
	(this is not the expected output)
	Successfully received and decrypted testfile (6400 bytes written).
	nittany% 
	</pre>


	<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
	<p>
	Students must turn in their tar file to Canvas by 5:00pm on
	September 21, 2022. Students must also turn in a <i>written report</i>
	that demonstrates (i.e., screenshots and explanations of what is 
	happening) all of the tasks in the rubric below. Note that the written
	report (using LaTeX, turn in PDF only) should NOT be inside the 
	tar file. Students should run their tests <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/class/cnt5410fa22/hw/example.txt">
	using this file</a> as their input.<br><br>

    <h2> A note about this assignment </h2>
    
    <p>The purpose of this assignment is to introduce familiarity to using
    cryptographic libraries in a somewhat realistic exercise. Because
    familiarity is the goal, certain steps have been simplified at the cost of
    security. One example of weakness is the fact that the PBKDF2 salt is not a
    random string. Making this specific change would make your application 
    robust in practice.
